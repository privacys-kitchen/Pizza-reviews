## Pizza-reviews

Recent publications in the field of data privacy remind me of the Hawaiian pizza. I see data privacy as the pizza; some privacy-enhancing-technologies (e.g., secure multiparty computation, homomorphic encryption, differential privacy, k-anonymity) as cheese and tomatoes; and some others (e.g., federated learning) as pineapples. Some people like the taste and prices of the Hawaiian pizza and some even like pizzas with cholocates/fried chickens as toppings; while others do not. 

Considering that there are many types of pizza on the market, and many new comers to this filed don’t know which ones taste good and which ones are cheap, I’ve decided to write a series of pizza reviews.
